## CHALLENGE 2



Studying the resources provided, especially bare metal programming, was really helpful. 
I learned how to write code at a low level by directly manipulating memory, understanding memory addresses, different ports, and bit shifting.
By putting all this together, I realized that using push buttons and LEDs, I could simulate and analyze code effectively.
