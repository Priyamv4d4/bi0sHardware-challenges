## CHALLENGE 4


.Components such as the 16x2 I2C LCD display, keypad, and servo motor were connected to the Arduino board following the circuit diagram.

. I opted for a 16x2 I2C LCD display instead of the OLED display due to difficulties in displaying output on the OLED screen.

. Upon entering the correct pin, servo motor was activated to inlock the door.

. Utilized LCD display to provide feedcback on the status of the lock system..
