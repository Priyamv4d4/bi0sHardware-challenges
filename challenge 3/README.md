## CHALLENGE 3

. The first Arduino acts as the data transmitter.

. I Connected a potentiometer to analog pin A0 of Arduino 1.

. Then connected the TX  pin of Arduino 1 to the RX  pin  of Arduino 2 using a jumper wire.

.Set  the second Arduino  as the receiver.

.Connected Arduino 2 with a 16x2 LCD display module.

.Made sure that the wiring is done properly between  Arduino 2 and the LCD display.

.Successfully established UART communication between Arduino 1 and Arduino 2, transmitting potentiometer data from Arduino 1 to 
 Arduino 2.
