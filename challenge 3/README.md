## CHALLENGE 3


.I began by connecting one Arduino(Sendor Arduino) to a potentiometer and printed the collected data to the serial monitor.

.The second Arduino( Reciever Arduino) was set to recieve the data sent by sender arduino using UART communicaton protocol.

. To display data on 16x2 LCD the necessary library #include <LiquidCrystal.h> was used.

. Using multiple potentiometer helped to debug different part of the code one by one.
