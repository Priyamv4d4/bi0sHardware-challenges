## CHALLENGE 5


.First learned what Caesar Cipher algorithm is.

.Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 bits per second.

.Check if there is incoming data available on the serial port.

.Serial monitor reads the incoming character.

.If the character is an alphabet, it decrypts it using the decrypt function and prints the decoded character to the serial port.

.If the character is not an alphabet, it prints it directly to the serial port.

.Checks if a given character is an alphabet (either uppercase or lowercase).

.Returns true if the character is an alphabet, otherwise false.

.Decrypts an input character using a Caesar Cipher with a specified shift value.

.Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters separately.

.Returns the decrypted character.
