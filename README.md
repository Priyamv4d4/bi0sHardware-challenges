## INTRODUCTION

Hey there! I'm Priyamvada M, a student from the Electronics and Communication Engineering department. I've enjoyed tinkering with hardware, from circuits to Arduino projects, and even exploring simulation platforms like Tinkercad and Wowki. Each project has been a learning experience, increasing my curiosity and passion for electronics. While I've got a decent handle on circuits and Arduino, I'm always eager to learn more and team up with fellow enthusiasts. Joining the bi0shardware club feels like the perfect next step to connect with others, tackle cool projects together, and keep growing in this awesome field.
