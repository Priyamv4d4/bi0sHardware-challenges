## CHALLENGE 4


.Components such as the 16x2 I2C LCD display, keypad, and servo motor were connected to the Arduino board following the circuit diagram.

. Connected the LCD to the Arduino using the I2C interface. The I2C interface requires only two wires for communication (SDA and SCL)
 in addition to power  and ground  connections.

.I replaced the OLED display initialization and printing functions with the equivalent functions for the LiquidCrystal_I2C library.
due to difficulties in displaying output on the OLED screen.

.Connected the servo motor to one of the digital pins (e.g., pin 11) on the Arduino

.Connected the keypad's row pins to digital pins 7, 6, 5, and 4 on the Arduino.

.Connected the keypad's column pins to digital pins 3, 2, 1, and 0 on the Arduino.

.Connected the SDA (Serial Data) pin of the LCD to the Arduino's A4 pin.

.Connectedor was activated to inlock the door.

. Utilized LCD display to provide feedcback on the status of the lock system..
